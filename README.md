# Virtual-House-Tour
OpenGL project where, using C++, we created a virtual house

Two stories house with lighting, textures, .mdl's, stairs, collisions and a particle fountain.
Academic Project made for one of our classes.

Total of 3 elements:

  • Pedro Coelho - ME - Made the xml/xsd structure and imported it to the project to create the house dynamically.
                      - Created the estructure of the house, made the blueprints and handled XML import and Zip extraction.
  
  • Pedro Magalhães   - Handled the import of .mdl, collisions and the stairs.
  
  • João Cabral       - Handled textures, positioning the .mdl and the fountain.

				C:\GLUT\glut32
				C:\GLUT\GL\GLAux
				C:\GLUT\GL\glut
			
• OpenAL	->	C:\Program Files\OpenAL 1.1 SDK\...
